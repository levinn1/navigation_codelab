# Flutter Routes & Navigation

This Flutter application demonstrates how to create a multi-screen app with named routes and navigation between different screens. The app includes three screens:
1. **First Screen**: Light blue background, includes buttons to navigate to the second and third screens.
2. **Second Screen**: Light green background, includes buttons to navigate back to the first screen or to the third screen.
3. **Third Screen**: Orange background, includes buttons to navigate back to the first or second screens.

The application also uses a **Drawer** for consistent navigation across screens, with the navigation menu replacing the back arrow on the second and third screens.
